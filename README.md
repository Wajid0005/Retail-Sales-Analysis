# SQL Retail Sales Analysis

This project uses SQL to analyze a retail sales dataset. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer 10 key business questions, uncovering insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

The project followed a structured data analysis process:

1.  **Database Setup:** A schema (`sql_p1`) and table (`retail_sales_data`) were created to hold the sales information.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** A check was performed to identify any `NULL` values across all columns, ensuring data integrity before analysis.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Ten specific SQL queries were written to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL:** Used for all data definition, cleaning, and analysis tasks.

## 📊 SQL Queries and Analysis

Here are the 10 business questions that were answered, along with the SQL queries used to solve them.

### 1. Sales per Gender and Category
Count the number of purchases broken down by both customer gender and product category.

```sql
select 
	gender,
    category,
    count(*) as NUM_OF_PURCHASED
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
group by 
	gender, 
    category
order by
	gender,
    category;
2. Sales on a Specific Date (Nov 5, 2022)
Retrieve all sales data for a single day and calculate the total revenue for that day.

SQL

select * from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
where sale_date = '2022-11-05';

select sum(total_sales) as TOTAL_SALES
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
where sale_date =  '2022-11-05';
3. Filtered Transactions
Find all 'Clothing' transactions from November 2022 where the quantity sold was 3 or more.

SQL

select *
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
where 
	month(sale_date) = 11
    and
    category = 'clothing'
    and
    quantiy >= 3
 order by quantiy;
4. Total Sales by Category
Calculate the total revenue generated by each product category.

SQL

select
	category as CATEGORY,
    sum(total_sale) as TOTAL_SALES
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
group by category
order by CATEGORY desc;
5. Average Customer Age by Category
Find the average age of customers who purchased products in the 'Beauty' category.

SQL

select 
	avg(age) as AVERAGE_AGE
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
where category = 'Beauty';
6. High-Value Transactions
Identify all transactions where the total_sale was greater than 1,000.

SQL

select * from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
where total_sale > 1000
order by total_sale;
7. Monthly Sales Analysis & Top Sales
Analyze sales trends over time, including average monthly sales and identifying top-performing individual sales.

7.1. Average Sale per Month/Year

SQL

select
	extract(year from sale_date) as sale_year,
    extract(month from sale_date) as sale_month,
    avg(total_sale) as avg_sales
    
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data

group by
	sale_year,
    sale_month
order by
	sale_year,
    sale_month;
7.2. Top 10 Sales Greater than Average Find the top 10 individual sales that were higher than the overall average sale.

SQL

select
	extract(year from sale_date) as YEAR,
    extract(month from sale_date) as MONTH,
    extract(day from sale_date) as DAY,
    total_sale as SALES_GREATER_THAN_AVG
from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
where 
	total_sale > (
		select avg(total_sale)
        from sql_p1.retail_sales_data
        )
order by
	SALES_GREATER_THAN_AVG desc
    limit  10;
8. Top 5 Transactions
Identify the top 5 largest individual transactions based on total_sale.

SQL

select
	ï»¿transactions_id as TRANSACTION_ID,
    sum(total_sale) as TOTAL_SPENT
from
	sql_p1.retail_sales_data
group by ï»¿transactions_id
order by TOTAL_SPENT desc
limit 5;
9. Unique Transactions per Category
Count the number of unique transactions for each product category.

SQL

select
	category,
    count(distinct ï»¿transactions_id) as UNIQUE_CUSTOMER
    
from 
	sql_p1.retail_sales_data
group by
	category;
10. Sales by Time of Day
Create time-based shifts (Morning, Noon, Evening, Night) and count the number of transactions in each shift.

SQL

select
	case
		when sale_time between '06:00:00' and '11:59:59' then 'MORNING'
        when sale_time between '12:00:00' and '17:59:59' then 'NOON'
        when sale_time between '18:00:00' and '20:59:59' then 'EVENING'
		else 'NIGHT'
	end as sales_shift ,
    count(*) as Transaction
from 
sql_p1.retail_sales_data
group by sales_shift
order by Transaction desc
;

🧠 Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated
This project showcases a wide range of SQL skills, including:

Data Definition Language (DDL): CREATE SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE

Data Cleaning: IS NULL checks

Filtering: WHERE with multiple AND conditions

Aggregation: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), COUNT(DISTINCT)

Grouping: GROUP BY on single and multiple columns

Date/Time Functions: month(), extract(), BETWEEN on TIME data

Conditional Logic: CASE statements

Subqueries: Used in the WHERE clause

Ordering & Limiting: ORDER BY, DESC, LIMIT
